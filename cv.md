### Profile

Due to my work history i gained experience in organization of various events and working with people.
But once i felt craving for some other sphere where i could make things i can be proud of. I started to attend courses of graphic design, and as a result discovered for myself front-end development.
After some time of self-learning HTML, CSS i started [cources up skill lab](https://olgamardvilko.github.io/up-skill-lab/#3c6f4b4af8). And must say i feel this is the sphere i'm interested in, i'm ready to discover it more and more.
My goal right now is to obtain enough practical skills to get a job offer. Ability to learn fast and sufficient level of English are with me.
